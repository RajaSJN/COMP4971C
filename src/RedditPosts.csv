Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.

* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.
   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?
   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***TLDR:***

Don't give Price targets within any specified time frame. It actually hurts bullish sentiment for a squeeze. 

Don't focus on ""trust me, bro"". Focus on these areas to determine that it is worthwhile to hold for a true short squeeze. 

**Recipe to an actual squeeze worth holding.**

1.) Is there high short interest?

2.) Is there a bullish catalyst that recently spiked buying pressure?

3.) Is CTB increasing? 

4.) Is FTD increasing with consistently high volume and low turnover? 

If yes to all of these, then share prices will climb. It takes weeks if not months though.

Someone commented on a $TMC hype post asking: what does this company even do?

After getting berated by WSB finest short squeezers with:

*“we don’t ask questions here”*

*“do we even care?”*

*“I think it’s a tech company”*

*“this may be the least important question on a thread I have ever seen”*

I had to say something.. so I responded *“metals or something”*. I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future.

Regardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you’re not, here is why you should.

At the end of the day, we’re here to make money so lets go

2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.

None of this is financial advice, do your own DD.

I just learned how to read so if there’s mistakes let me know.

# 

# Part 1. metals or something

Check out the company website. Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their investor site, and 8K filings.

They have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope.

(Auto mod doesn't like the link, but it's metals dot co)

**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we’re fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.

**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport

What do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.

What’s the second thing they need? Metals.

Carbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires… a fuck ton of metals.

The cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ushpohm7lao71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc67ab4fc3a2042435d6451a4f8bc4bdf6b8691

These ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn’t the only thing scarred)

But these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely.

https://preview.redd.it/q3yodmw8lao71.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def610525e2f4887be3908a05f9636c702046ab0

They contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it’s estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.

TMC’s main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:

[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/47y79v6alao71.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f34d44c47d8aeb948519866613d34ce41c2ee51)

It goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.

The NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world’s** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).

To put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.

And $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.

HOLY MOLY

That’s a lot of rocks.

Their plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they’re looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.

[base station](https://preview.redd.it/09tncwkumao71.png?width=2646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9712be824ec6bd7835de1500b464c009a94a1ce)

&gt;Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.

https://preview.redd.it/853cc7udlao71.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3237cd820efde72e0b8747b4a290c8072b773ff1

But Junkyard-Razor74, don’t we have metals on land that we’re mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We’re trying to save it right? Rightttt?

[and that's just the beginning for climate spending](https://preview.redd.it/omfc8oxelao71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1678ebb747bb9286258c6558085f31fcce8a605b)

Infrastructure, auto industry, transit, power sector, buildings, innovative technologies. They all need metals. And many of them batteries. This is where the metal company is positioning themselves to bank. The future is green 💵 💵 💵 ☘️☘️☘️

[land mining bad, sea mining good](https://preview.redd.it/0c3tkkhhlao71.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdf64c78660dbdf9922ec995a324628087ed2429)

&gt;Using nodules to create EV batteries will generate at least **75% less CO2** than ores from land-based mines.

Cool. So now we’re on the same page. Electric cars have batteries, batteries need metals, TMC make batteries good for planet.

# Part 2. why it doesn’t matter (right now)

Information directly from form [8K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/) dated 9/15/2021.

DeepGreen Metals and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation completed Their business combination and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker $TMC on Sept 10th, 2021.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of DeepGreen:

The shareholders and the option holders of DeepGreen became entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for their DeepGreen Common Shares and options to purchase DeepGreen Common Shares, as applicable, an aggregate of **229,162,651 TMC Common Shares** (which includes TMC Common Shares underlying options).

Each Share is automatically convertible into TMC Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation entered into Subscription Agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of **11,030,000 TMC Common Shares** at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of **$110,300,000** (the “PIPE Financing”).

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation also entered into Subscription Agreements for an aggregate of **22,000,000 Common Shares**, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of **$220,000,000** with two investors who defaulted on the Closing Date under the Subscription Agreements. The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.

**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising

* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders**
* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing
* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and…
* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.

Here’s the kicker:

**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.

Can’t sell them until blah blah blah.

**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.

**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**

So you’re telling me that around 3.6 million shares have been shorted… when SUPPOSEDLY the available public float is 2.7 million shares…

What am I missing here, are we all retarded? Did I actually learn how to read?

The short interest data of 3.6 million shares short **seems to be** from when the float was larger, before redemption. Most of them **should’ve** covered. **IF** the short interest is the same then yes, the SI is over 100%+

I don’t even care about the short interest. It can be 30,000 or 3,000,000.

The public fucking float is **2.7 million shares**. According to the SEC filings and the CEO himself. Take a look: [Listen to the first 1 ½ minutes](https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1438917219732312067?s=20).

Someone is buying up $6 calls expiring 10/15. Why deep into the money? Possibly to hedge a short. Or possibly to exercise and get this gamma squeeze going. IDK just speculation. Unusual none the less.

Notice on 9/16 we had a “Above the Ask buy” at $12.98 per share.

The following day 9/17 we had a buy at $10 per share. The price we needed to stay above. The support came just in time.

Looks like TMC is trading in a rising channel and we have a gap to fill on the 1 hour above $12.

Ballish!

**TL,DR:** The Metals Company is developing the world’s largest estimated source of battery metals, with enough nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese to electrify the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. They do this through innovative technology and deep-sea mining, which is healthier for our planet and lucrative for our pockets in the long term.

**TL,DR;TL,DR:** The float is 2.7 million everywhere you look. Confirmed again and again. Shorts + Calls ITM + Social Media Interest + hidden ballish divergence = Not enough shares to go around = Up

Regardless if you like the stock or just here for a quick swing, you are in the right place. You have a company sitting on a gold mine (other metals instead) in a great position to increase their market capitalization and do their part and make the world a bit cleaner.

I knew the cost to borrow was between between 500-800%, depending on source, but it wasn't until I did some basic math until I realized just how much it costs shorts to, well, stay short.

**Someone that is short 3,500 shares (about $105K) is paying at a minimum $1,458 and up to $2,331 per day to keep that short. That is a significant amount of money per day to hold short here, IMO.**

Moreover, those are ""per day"" fees that are incurred even when the market is closed.  So, roughly **$2.9K-4.6K to hold that short over the weekend**.  ***That's just bananas!*** *(see what I did there?)*

I know a lot of longs are scared ATM, but man when you look at those numbers time is really not on the side of shorts unless they can get those borrow fees down by scaring retail out of their positions.  I keep seeing people say September 27th some restricted shares unlock and add to the float, but that's not what I see in the SEC filings.

In the SEC filings it says that shares will not come on the market until 180 days after the merger was completed, which was Aug 27, 2021. So, that would mean **more shares are not coming on the market until Wednesday, February 23, 2022**. By then, shorts would easily have lost all gains made Friday and then some (if the borrow rate remains elevated).

Just kidding, of course nobody is talking about it because US weed stocks have been a messy late term abortion for the last 7 months. However, things are about to change in a BIG way. Lemme explain.

US MJ operators known as MSO (Multi State Operators) have to live in the shitty underworld of pink slip purgatory. They want to uplist to heaven (Nasdaq,NYSE). The SAFE Banking Act has potential to be the catalyst that will give MSO's their wings and uplist. Whats the SAFE Banking Act? It allows federal banks to work with plant-touching US MJ companies. Bankers have been lobbying congress for years because every greedy banker fck knows the weed industry is booming and they havent been able to wet their beak. The banks and tutes want in, SAFE is their gateway. Now begins the dice roll:

1. Last wednesday, Rep Perlmutter skillfully added SAFE to the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) as a proposed amendment. The NDAA has passed every year for the last 60 years (knock on wood). On Monday Sept 20th, the House Rules Cmte votes on the proposed amendments. Rep Perlmutter is on this cmte and all 13 members live in states with active rec and/or med weed. I give this a 90% chance of passing
2. Next up is the Senate. Once SAFE gets added to the NDAA, it gets sent to the Senate Armed Services Cmte. You'd think we'd be fcked from the sounds of it BUT 21 of the 26 members live in states with active rec and/or med weed. 8 members are co-sponsors of SAFE. Surprising all sounds like a slam dunk but Chucky Schumer might cause a mild stink about SAFE as he and Booker want all the shine from their comprehensive MJ bill created earlier this year. However, I think they take temperature of the room and will go with the bi-partisan win. No need to shoot down SAFE which is essential to establishing the financial plumbing for the industry when federal legalization occurs. I give this 60% chance of passing.
3. Ok cool. SAFE gets added in the Senate, the NDAA is voted, passed and signed in November. Now what about uplisting? SAFE does not have language for uplistings. The door is left open. Who will enter? FinCEN/AML. They have the authority to change the rules that allow MJ plant-touching businesses to access US equity markets. SAFE is the domino we need to trigger FinCEN/AML to update their regulatory guidance within 180 days. Because this is an unprecedented event and the ultimate prize, I will go with a 20% chance of happening which if it does will occur by the latest Q2/2022.

How to play this is with thru US MJ companies but you cant talk about them in here so for now go with the top tier Canadian companies since they have vested interests in US MSO's. If uplisting occurs in Q2/2022 expect the media hype fest to begin. CNBC will be pump masters supreme celebrating weed like its the cumming of christ. The ponytail brothers will be hooting and hollering with unusual call activity. It will be a total FOMO shit show so saddle up now and get ready for the ride.
